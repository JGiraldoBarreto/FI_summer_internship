# FI_summer_internship

This repo contains the Cryo-CV programs developed in the Flatiron Summer Internship, 2022.

Three main folders are in here:\

The "toy_system_sampling" folder, which contains the necessary files and programs to run the cryo-CV method for a toy system (See the README file within the corresponding folder).\

The "Gaussian_Images_tutorial" folder, which contains the program to generate the gaussian images, given a grid, and the number of images per point in the grid, in Matrix form, and a rapid test of cryo-CV toy system (See the README file within the corresponding folder).\

The MD_sampling folder, which contains the programs and the files needed to run the cryo-CV method for MD data. In particular, the MD data here is from the VGVAPG (hexapeptide) system (see: Donati, L. & Keller, B. G. Girsanov reweighting for metadynamics simulations. J. Chem. Phys. 149, 072335. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5027728 (2018).) (See the README file within the corresponding folder).
